        <h1>Foals - Late Night</h1>
        <p>Oh, I hoped that you were somebody,<br>
        Someone I could count,<br>
        To pull me to my feet again,<br>
        When I was in doubt.</p>

        <p>Oh, now Mama, do you hear me<br>
            Calling out your name?<br>
        Oh, now Mama, do you hear me<br>
        Calling out your name?<br>
        Calling out your name?</p>

        <p>Now I'm the last cowboy in this town.<br>
        Empty veins and my plastic, broken crown.<br>
        They said I swam the sea, then ran aground,<br>
        They said I once was lost, but now I'm truly found.</p>

        <p>And I know the place but not the way,<br>
        I feel, I feel no shame.<br>
        Oh, now Mama, do you hear my fear?<br>
        It's coming after me.</p>

        <p>Calling out your name!<br>ls -al ~/.ssh
        Calling out your name!</p>

        <p>Stay with me... Stay with me...</p>

        <p>But you threw your heart away.<br>
        Oh, I know just what to say<br>
        Through the phone cord, it can wait,<br>
        We still got time to say.</p>

        <p>And I know you ran away.<br>
        Oh, I know my feeling, OK.?<br>
        But now I've found love and the feeling wont go,<br>
        Now I found love but the feeling wont go.<br>
        I see you walk away.<br>
        Feeling okay, now,<br>
        Happy now? <br></p>
        <p>Stay with me...zmieniam w dowolny sposob. zmieniam w dowolny sposob 2</p>
